abstract = {This paper summarizes the findings of a workshop convened in the United States in 2018 to discuss methods in coastal and estuarine modeling and to propose key areas of research and development needed to improve their accuracy and reliability. The focus of this paper is on physical processes, and we provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art based on presentations and discussions at the meeting, which revolved around the four primary themes of parameterizations, numerical methods, in-situ and remote-sensing measurements, and high-performance computing. A primary outcome of the workshop was agreement on the need to reduce subjectivity and improve reproducibility in modeling of physical processes in the coastal ocean. Reduction of subjectivity can be accomplished through development of standards for benchmarks, grid generation, and validation, and reproducibility can be improved through development of standards for input/output, coupling and model nesting, and reporting. Subjectivity can also be reduced through more engagement with the applied mathematics and computer science communities to develop methods for robust parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. Such engagement could be encouraged through more collaboration between the forward and inverse modeling communities and integration of more applied math and computer science into oceanography curricula. Another outcome of the workshop was agreement on the need to develop high-resolution models that scale on advanced HPC systems to resolve, rather than parameterize, processes with horizontal scales that range between the depth and the internal Rossby deformation scale. Unsurprisingly, more research is needed on parameterizations of processes at scales smaller than the depth, including parameterizations for drag (including bottom roughness, bedforms, vegetation and corals), wave breaking, and air–sea interactions under strong wind conditions. Other topics that require significantly more work to better parameterize include nearshore wave modeling, sediment transport modeling, and morphodynamics. Finally, it was agreed that coastal models should be considered as key infrastructure needed to support research, just like laboratory facilities, field instrumentation, and research vessels. This will require a shift in the way proposals related to coastal ocean modeling are reviewed and funded.},

abstract = {Dissolved polymers, especially polysaccharides, are thought to play an important role in formation of larger organic aggregates in the sea. Phytoplankton may exude considerable quantities of polymers, although the particular conditions conducive to release of these substances are not known. Such processes are implicated in the formation of large-scale gelatinous mucus aggregations in the Adriatic Sea. We investigated extracellular carbohydrate release in the diatoms Coscinodiscus granii, Stephanopyxis palmenana, Skeletonema costatum, Nitzschia delicatissima, Thalassiosira weissflogii, and 2 species of Chaetoceros, under different culture conditions, and examined whether these exudates interfered with copepod grazing. The copepod species studied are typical of Adriatic coastal enviroments. Our results indicate that during the exponential growth phase the contribution of the high-molecular-weight carbohydrate (HMWCHO) fraction to extracellular release was minor, except in phosphorus Limited medium. A shift towards an increased significance of HMWCHO was observed in the stationary phase for all species tested. Grazing experiments with Temora longicornis and Pseudo-calanus elongatus demonstrated that copepod feeding was inhibited by HMWCHO diatom exudate and also stationary phase culture filtrate. Feeding rates were also adversely affected by the presence of pure HMW dextran used as a model substance. Copepod feeding was more strongly inhibited by &atom HMWCHO exudates than an equivalent concentration of pure dextran, suggesting an additional response to the chemical stimuli of algal exudates.},

abstract = {Early life stages of fish (eggs and larvae) are particularly vulnerable with mortality rates of up to 99\% recorded for a large number of species. High mortality rates result from the limited swimming ability of larvae preventing them from escaping sub-optimal environmental conditions, predators or low prey density areas. In this context, estuaries are key nursery areas for larval and juvenile fish. Estuarine habitats offer environmental conditions favourable to the survival and growth of early stages, through abundant good-quality prey and protection from predators. A vast literature on larvae occurring in temperate estuaries exists, but an overall perspective is lacking. The occurrence of fish larvae in temperate estuaries depends on several factors. First, the choice of spawning time and location is primordial, as they have evolved to optimise the entry and the retention of larvae in the estuary as well as the conditions experienced by young stages. Secondly, larval growth and survival depend on key environmental factors (e.g. salinity, water temperature, freshwater inputs, turbidity and dissolved oxygen concentration). Knowledge of the larval dynamics in temperate estuaries is scarce for some topics and biased towards some species or geographical areas. The main goal of the present literature review is to synthesise existing knowledge regarding spawning timing and location and larval ecology for fish species occurring in coasts and estuaries, identifying the main patterns, consensus or conflicting hypotheses and highlighting major gaps. Research needs and future perspectives were outlined.},

The Pearl River estuary (PRE) is a dynamically complex estuary, and the environment of PRE is significantly impacted by anthropogenic activities, variation of phytoplankton community structure in the PRE are complex. This review aims to compare phytoplankton species, species diversity, and abundance variation characteristics from the 1980s and 2020s, evaluate the overall trend of phytoplankton in the PRE, and discuss the main environmental factors affecting phytoplankton growth in the PRE. The data from the past 40 years in PRE showed that the number of phytoplankton species significantly decreased (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the abundance of phytoplankton at the 10-year scale, however, the fluctuation range of the abundance has increased. Under the conditions of a decreasing species number and no significant difference in abundance, the species diversity of phytoplankton showed a downward trend. In addition, the dominant phytoplankton species in the nearshore waters were relatively homogenous, and the abundance of phytoplankton in the nearshore waters was higher than that in the open waters, which suggested that human activities have a great influence. This review can form the basis for facilitating health management in the PRE ecosystem. Further, relevant guidelines can be developed and implemented for promoting the ecological health of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and ensuring its sustainable development.},

Taking this into account the 50th Conference of the Estuarine Coastal Sciences Association was held in Venice, Italy, in June 2012 with the maxim 'Today's science for tomorrow's management'. As a result of the Conference this special issue of Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science focusses on 'Pressures, stresses, shocks and trends in estuarine ecosystems'. Here we identify the major hazards to estuarine ecosystems as belonging to three categories: human activities, climate change and extreme events; and we discuss the special issue contributions in this context. Moreover, studies of indicators of environmental change and larger scale assessments of estuarine ecosystems are also highlighted. There are examples providing scientific evidence for a 'successful' management in terms of ecosystem recovery. However, for today's and future management it appears mandatory to use the term 'successful' in the sense of being beneficial for the ecosystem as well as for the stakeholders. With this in mind, we discuss the future of, and challenges to, estuarine ecosystems in the light of the environmental change of the Anthropocene in a final section. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Sedimentation rates were determined for various diatom species, and both average and maximum sinking velocities of sedimenting diatoms were calculated during a spring bloom investigation in the central Baltic Sea in 1986. Up to 25 and 50\% of the Chaetoceros spp. and Thalassiosira levanderi populations, respectively, sedimented daily. Daily sedimentation rates of other diatoms, dinoflagellates and Mesodinium rubrum, however, were less than 1\% of their respective standing stocks. The T. levanderi population was divided into two subpopulations: while one was sinking, the second was actively dividing (recognizable by paired-cell stages) with a specific growth rate of >0.2 to 0.3 d-1. These paired cells were never found in sediment trap samples. The average sinking velocity of Chaetoceros spp. was 15 to 30 m d-1; that of T. levanderi was higher. The maximum sinking velocity of cells was at least 70 m d-1. According to these observations, the formation of aggregates (which enhances sinking velocity), and their sedimentation, represent a highly selective process. This indicates that diatom aggregates do not act as roving filters, sweeping the water clear while sinking. {\textcopyright} 1991 Springer-Verlag.},

We applied a combination of field observation, numerical modeling, and remote sensing to display and interpret the spatial gradient of phytoplankton biomass in a Dutch tidal bay (the Eastern Scheldt) on the east coast of the North Sea. The 19 years (1995-2013) of monitoring data reveal a seaward increasing trend in chlorophyll-<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula"><i>a</i></span> (chl <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula"><i>a</i></span>) concentrations during the spring bloom. Using a calibrated and validated three-dimensional hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model, two idealized model scenarios were run: switching off the suspension feeders and halving the open-boundary nutrient and phytoplankton loading. Results reveal that bivalve grazing exerts a dominant control on phytoplankton in the bay and that the tidal import mainly influences algal biomass near the mouth. Satellite data captured a post-bloom snapshot that indicated the temporally variable phytoplankton distribution. Based on a literature review, we found five common spatial phytoplankton patterns in global estuarine-coastal ecosystems for comparison with the Eastern Scheldt case: seaward increasing, seaward decreasing, concave with a chlorophyll maximum, weak spatial gradients, and irregular patterns. We highlight the temporal variability of these spatial patterns and the importance of anthropogenic and environmental influences.},

This paper synthesises greenhouse gas data measured in UK estuary studies, highlighting that urban wastewater loading is significantly correlated with both methane (P < 0.001) and nitrous oxide (P < 0.005) concentrations. It demonstrates that specific estuary typologies render them more sensitive to anthropogenic influences on greenhouse gas production, particularly estuaries that experience low oxygen levels due to reduced mixing and stratification or high sediment oxygen demand. Significantly, we find that estuaries with high urban wastewater loading may be hidden sources of greenhouse gases globally. Synthesising available information, a conceptual model for greenhouse gas concentrations in estuaries with different morphologies and mixing regimes is presented. Applications of this model should help identification of estuaries susceptible to anthropogenic impacts and potential hotspots for greenhouse gas emissions.},

abstract = {Microalgae are ideal candidates for bioremediation and biotechnological applications. However, salinity and nutrient resource availability vary seasonally and between cultivation sites, potentially impacting on biomass productivity. The aim of this study was to screen pollutant-tolerant freshwater microalgae (Desmodesmus armatus, Mesotaenium sp., Scenedesmus quadricauda and Tetraedron sp.), isolated from Tarong power station ash-dam water, for their tolerance to cultivation at a range of salinities. To determine if biochemical composition could be manipulated, the effects of 4-day nutrient limitation were also determined. Microalgae were cultured at 2, 8, 11 and 18 ppt salinity, and nutrient uptake was monitored daily. Growth, total lipid, fatty acid (FA), and amino acid contents were quantified in biomass harvested while nutrient-replete and, after 4 days, nutrient-deplete. D. armatus showed the highest salinity tolerance actively growing in up to 18 ppt while Mesotaenium sp. was the least halotolerant with decreasing growth rates from 11 ppt. However, Mesotaenium sp. at 2 and 8 ppt had the highest biomass productivity and nutrient requirements of the four species, making it ideal for nutrient remediation of eutrophic freshwater effluents. Salinity and nutrient status had minimal influence on total lipid and FA contents in D. armatus and Mesotaenium sp., while nutrient depletion induced an increase of total lipid and FAs in S. quadricauda and Tetraedron sp., which was further increased with increasing salinity. As none of the growth conditions affected amino acid profiles of the species, these findings provide a basis for species selection based on site-specific salinity conditions and nutrient resource availability.},

Diatoms from unialgal cultures and mixed populations from intertidal flats appeared to be highly tolerant of extreme salinities. During short-term exposures (20 min) the net photosynthesis of the algae did not drop below 70\% of the initial values, within the salinity range 4.0 to 60.0\‰. Prolonged exposure (up to 6 h) gave essentially the same results.

Two species, Navicula arenaria and Nitzschia sigma, were cultured in media ranging in salinity from 8.0 to 45.0‰ and from 2.0 to 45‰, respectively.

abstract = {Estuaries are biogeochemical hot spots because they receive large inputs of nutrients and organic carbon from land and oceans to support high rates of metabolism and primary production. We synthesize published rates of annual phytoplankton primary production (APPP) in marine ecosystems influenced by connectivity to land - estuaries, bays, lagoons, fjords and inland seas. Review of the scientific literature produced a compilation of 1148 values of APPP derived from monthly incubation assays to measure carbon assimilation or oxygen production. The median value of median APPP measurements in 131 ecosystems is 185 and the mean is 252 g C m-2 yr-1, but the range is large: from -105 (net pelagic production in the Scheldt Estuary) to 1890 g C mg-2 yr-1 (net phytoplankton production in Tamagawa Estuary). APPP varies up to 10-fold within ecosystems and 5-fold from year to year (but we only found eight APPP series longer than a decade so our knowledge of decadal-scale variability is limited). We use studies of individual places to build a conceptual model that integrates the mechanisms generating this large variability: nutrient supply, light limitation by turbidity, grazing by consumers, and physical processes (river inflow, ocean exchange, and inputs of heat, light and wind energy). We consider method as another source of variability because the compilation includes values derived from widely differing protocols. A simulation model shows that different methods reported in the literature can yield up to 3-fold variability depending on incubation protocols and methods for integrating measured rates over time and depth. Although attempts have been made to upscale measures of estuarine-coastal APPP, the empirical record is inadequate for yielding reliable global estimates. The record is deficient in three ways. First, it is highly biased by the large number of measurements made in northern Europe (particularly the Baltic region) and North America. Of the 1148 reported values of APPP, 958 come from sites between 30 and 60° N; we found only 36 for sites south of 20° N. Second, of the 131 ecosystems where APPP has been reported, 37\% are based on measurements at only one location during 1 year. The accuracy of these values is unknown but probably low, given the large interannual and spatial variability within ecosystems. Finally, global assessments are confounded by measurements that are not intercomparable because they were made with different methods. Phytoplankton primary production along the continental margins is tightly linked to variability of water quality, biogeochemical processes including ocean-atmosphere CO2 exchange, and production at higher trophic levels including species we harvest as food. The empirical record has deficiencies that preclude reliable global assessment of this key Earth system process. We face two grand challenges to resolve these deficiencies: (1) organize and fund an international effort to use a common method and measure APPP regularly across a network of coastal sites that are globally representative and sustained over time, and (2) integrate data into a unifying model to explain the wide range of variability across ecosystems and to project responses of APPP to regional manifestations of global change as it continues to unfold. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2014.},

abstract = {A simple zero-dimensional model was developed which describes the oxygen concentrations and major nutrient processes in the tidal influenced Elbe estuary. The model was calibrated by way of comparison with continuous measurements of the oxygen- and chlorophyll concentrations at the non-tidal part of the estuary. A special calibration method was applied which utilised the fact that natural steady-state conditions are often found during which the range and the average value of the day-night fluctuations remain constant over a period of several days. Subsequent model runs were carried out to simulate the oxygen concentrations downstream, i.e., after a few days of transport time of the water body. The varying depth of the Elbe downstream of Hamburg harbour was taken into account by altering the model parameters 'light penetration' and 'aeration'. The oxygen concentrations resulting from the model showed a distinct minimum, which agreed well with the minimum measured in longitudinal profiles, thus indicating that the occurrence of the oxygen minimum in the Elbe estuary can mainly be explained by the processes included in our simple model. Sensitivity checks identified some relationships, e.g., light intensity ↔ growth rate, which are critical for the oxygen balance. With this work it could be demonstrated that even simple zero-dimensional models can improve our understanding of the complex interrelationship of different physical, chemical and biological processes in rivers and that such models can be used for simple scenarios in water quality management.},

abstract = {Changes in the transport and sedimentation of suspended particulate matter (SPM) after deepening of the navigation channel of the Elbe Estuary in 1999 were studied. Long-term series of the grain size composition of sediments and sedimentation rates in the main stream and its branches (Nebenelben) were compared with changes in flow velocities and tidal water levels. In addition, water quality parameters like biological oxygen demand (BOD7), dissolved oxygen and particulate organic carbon (POC) were analysed to determine changes in the origin and fate of the SPM. In the main stream, deepening produced no significant changes of the flow velocities. However, there was a decrease of the mean tidal low water level between 5.7 and 8.1 cm at the upper end of the estuary. These small changes in hydrology had the effect that fine-grained suspended matter derived from freshwater run-off accumulated in the surface water of the freshwater region in the estuary and remained within this region until all degradable organic matter was consumed. Accumulation of the fine-grained SPM produced an increase of the <63 $\mu$m fraction in the sediments of the Hamburg harbour by about 20\% and in the SPM along the freshwater longitudinal profile up to about 120%. Coupled to this the mean BOD7 increased between May and August by 38%. Enhanced oxygen deficiencies thus occurred after 1999, with concentrations of below 6 mg O2 L-1 over a length of about 100 km along the freshwater longitudinal profile of the Elbe Estuary. In the shallow water regions present in the branches of the main stream, deepening of the navigation channel was followed by a 25% decrease in the flow velocities during low tide. This was coupled to an increase of the sedimentation rates which produced a rise of the sediment level between 0.7 and 1.5 m until 2004 and a permanent loss in the capacity of the branches for re-aeration of the open water. The results indicate that in tidal systems SPM might be more sensitive for monitoring changes in the transport regime than hydrological parameters. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to a combination of high turbidity and high river runoff, phytoplankton of the Gironde estuary differed in species composition and had lower cell abundancies and biomass compared with Elbe and Schelde. Phytoplankton structure and biomass of the polyhaline reaches of the Elbe and Schelde were quite comparable. They were characterized by the diatoms Skeletonema costatum and several Thalassiosira spp. and most probably developed in situ. The presence of tychoplanktonic species in these reaches indicates exchange with the intertidal flats. On the other hand, some marked differences were observed in the upper and tidal freshwater reaches of these two estuaries. In the oligohaline Schelde stations, phytoplankton populations were dominated by the diatom Cyclotella meneghiniana. The diatom Stephanodiscus hantzschii was dominant in the limnetic stations of the Elbe estuary. Despite the unfavourable light climate, the presence of the halophilous diatom C. meneghiniana in the Schelde estuary might indicate in situ development of phytoplankton populations. This could be attributed to the high residence time and the absence of grazers due to oxygen stress. In the Elbe, river runoff is too high (at least in spring) to permit in situ development of phytoplankton in the upper and freshwater tidal reaches.},

abstract = {We present a new 3D unstructured-grid model (SCHISM) which is an upgrade from an existing model (SELFE). The new advection scheme for the momentum equation includes an iterative smoother to reduce excess mass produced by higher-order kriging method, and a new viscosity formulation is shown to work robustly for generic unstructured grids and effectively filter out spurious modes without introducing excessive dissipation. A new higher-order implicit advection scheme for transport (TVD2) is proposed to effectively handle a wide range of Courant numbers as commonly found in typical cross-scale applications. The addition of quadrangular elements into the model, together with a recently proposed, highly flexible vertical grid system (Zhang et al., A new vertical coordinate system for a 3D unstructured-grid model. Ocean Model. 85, 2015), leads to model polymorphism that unifies 1D/2DH/2DV/3D cells in a single model grid. Results from several test cases demonstrate the model's good performance in the eddying regime, which presents greater challenges for unstructured-grid models and represents the last missing link for our cross-scale model. The model can thus be used to simulate cross-scale processes in a seamless fashion (i.e. from deep ocean into shallow depths).},

abstract = {Lagrangian particle tracking, based on currents derived from hydrodynamic models, is an important tool in quantifying bio-physical transports in the ocean. Particle tracking in the unstructured grids typically used in coastal regions is computationally slow, limiting the number of particles and ranges of behaviours that can be modeled. Techniques used in a new offline particle tracker “OceanTracker” are shown to be two orders of magnitude faster than those used in an existing ocean particle tracker for unstructured grids when run on a single computer core. More significantly, its computational speed can exceed that achieved when particle tracking on a regular grid. The techniques for unstructured grids make it possible to routinely calculate the trajectories of millions of particles. This large number of particles allows much better estimates of dispersion and transport statistics, particularly when the probability of connection is low but the consequences are significant, e.g. the spread of invasive species. It also enables wider exploration of parameter sensitivity and particles' bio-physical behaviours to provide more robust results. The speed increases result largely from exploiting history and reuse within the spatial interpolation of the hydrodynamic model's output. Using multiple computer cores further increased the speed to track a given number of particles.},

abstract = {Estuaries act as an organic matter and nutrient filter in the transition between the land, rivers and the ocean. In the past, high nutrient and organic carbon load and low oxygen concentration made the Elbe River estuary (NW Europe) a sink for dissolved inorganic nitrogen. A recent reduction in loads and subsequent recovery of the estuary changed its biogeochemical function, so that nitrate is no longer removed on its transition towards the coastal North Sea. Nowadays in the estuary, nitrification appears to be a significant nitrate source. To quantify nitrification and determine actively nitrifying regions in the estuary, we measured the concentrations of ammonium, nitrite and nitrate, the dual stable isotopes of nitrate and net nitrification rates in the estuary on five cruises from August 2012 to August 2013. The nitrate concentration increased markedly downstream of the port of Hamburg in summer and spring, accompanied by a decrease of nitrate isotope values that was clearest in summer exactly at the location where nitrate concentration started to increase. Ammonium and nitrite peaked in the Hamburg port region (up to 18 and 8 $\mu$mol L−1, respectively), and nitrification rates in this region were up to 7 $\mu$mol L−1 day−1. Our data show that coupled re-mineralization and nitrification are significant internal nitrate sources that almost double the estuary's summer nitrate concentration. Furthermore, we find that the port of Hamburg is a hot spot of nitrification, whereas the maximum turbidity zone (MTZ) only plays a subordinate role in turnover of nitrate.},

abstract = {Seasonal patterns in resource limitation of phytoplankton growth were assessed monthly within three large rivers with differing extents of water regulation. The Ohio River is regulated by low dams that do not substantially modify discharge, while the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers are impounded by a series of high dams to enhance water storage for downstream flood control. Laboratory dilution assays with light and nutrient manipulations indicated that light was the main factor limiting phytoplankton growth at irradiances below 7 E m-2 d-1. Light limited growth was frequent in the turbid, higher discharge of the Ohio River, but was rare in the heavily regulated Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. When irradiance exceeded 7 E m-2 d-1, phytoplankton were either P-limited (Cumberland River), co-limited by P and N (Tennessee River), or Si limited (Ohio River). Site-specific differences in nutrient limitation were consistent with differences in ambient nutrient levels, with the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers characterized by lower N and P concentrations, and the Ohio River by lower Si. Downstream nutrient depletion was evident in the Ohio River through comparison of an upstream and a downstream site, with nutrient limitation (Si) occurring more frequently downstream. Phytoplankton growth rates at ambient light and nutrient levels ranged from 0.1 to 1.5 d-1 in the Ohio River and 0.2 to 0.6 d-1 in the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. Growth rates were greatest at the onset of the summer base pool, as light intensities increased and nutrient levels were maximal. Our findings indicate that multiple factors regulate phytoplankton growth in regulated rivers and that spatial complexity may arise from differences in discharge and water aging.},

abstract = {Direct human interference has been shaping todays estuaries for centuries, and depletion of dissolved oxygen (DO) frequently occurs in such anthropogenically impacted estuaries. Whereas the role of nutrient input as a major human impact driving DO depletion is clear, the effect of bathymetric modifications as another human impact is less well-known. Here, we aim at a better understanding of how DO dynamics are influenced by bathymetric modifications and changed nutrient input. Therefore, we introduce a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model (Untrim-Delwaq) and develop an idealized one-dimensional set-up of a vertically well-mixed, funnel-shaped estuary with strong human impact. The set-up dimensions are inspired by the Elbe Estuary (Germany) and model results show good agreement in comparison to observational hydrodynamic and water quality data. In particular, the model reproduces the dynamics of the summer oxygen minimum which regularly develops in the estuarine freshwater part. Analysis of our model runs shows that the estuarine biogeochemistry is dominated by heterotrophic degradation processes rather than primary production because of severe light limitation. A scenario analysis indicates that a reduction in input load scales down all biogeochemical processes. In contrast, a bathymetric change affects the estuarine system and its DO in a more complex way. In particular, the interplay between surface-to-volume ratio and the degradability state of the organic material is the most important factor which determines the capacity to recover high DO mineralization losses by atmospheric input. Thus, our study demonstrates the relevance of bathymetric factors during the assessment of human interference on DO dynamics and biogeochemical processes in estuaries.},

abstract = {The Elbe estuary is a substantially engineered tidal water body that receives high loads of organic matter from the eutrophied Elbe river. The organic matter entering the estuary at the tidal weir is dominated by diatom populations that collapse in the deepened freshwater reach. Although the estuary's freshwater reach is considered to manifest vertically homogenous density distribution (i.e., to be well-mixed), several indicators like trapping of particulate organic matter, near-bottom oxygen depletion and ammonium accumulation suggest that the vertical exchange of organic particles and dissolved oxygen is weakened at least temporarily. To better understand the causal links between the hydrodynamics and the oxygen and nutrient cycling in the deepened freshwater reach of the Elbe estuary, we establish a three-dimensional coupled hydrodynamical-biogeochemical model. The model demonstrates good skill in simulating the variability of the physical and biogeochemical parameters in the focal area. Coupled simulations reveal that this region is a hotspot of the degradation of diatoms and organic matter transported from the shallow productive upper estuary and the tidal weir. In summer, the water column weakly stratifies when at the bathymetric jump warmer water from the shallow upper estuary spreads over the colder water of the deepened mid reaches. Enhanced thermal stratification also occurs also in the narrow port basins and channels. Model results show intensification of the particle trapping due to the thermal gradients. The stratification also reduces the oxygenation of the near-bottom region and sedimentary layer inducing oxygen depletion and accumulation of ammonium. The study highlights that the vertical resolution is important for the understanding and simulation of estuarine ecological processes, because even weak stratification impacts the cycling of nutrients via modulation of the vertical mixing of oxygen, particularly in deepened navigation channels and port areas.},

abstract = {Flocculation of 'sticky' phytoplankton cells into rapidly sinking aggregates has been invoked as a mechanism explaining mass sedimentation of phytoplankton blooms in the ocean. Phytoplankton stickiness, defined as the probability of adhesion upon collision, is one key factor determining the potential for aggregate formation. In the laboratory, we examined variation in stickiness in five species of diatoms and two species of flagellates grown in batch cultures. We also investigated the production of paniculate mucus by phytoplankton cells and its role in aggregate formation, and we studied the effects of solute exudates on cell stickiness. Four of the five diatoms investigated were significantly sticky, while one diatom and both of the flagellates were not sticky. Stickiness varied considerably within species. In the diatom Skeletonema costatum, the typical but not entirely consistent pattern was that stickiness decreased with age of the batch cultures. We were otherwise unable to establish consistent relationships between cell stickiness and the growth stage of the algae, environmental concentrations of inorganic nutrients, and abundances of suspended and epiphytic bacteria. We showed that the diatom S.costatum at times excretes a solute substance that depresses flocculation. This may reduce cell losses from the euphotic zone during the growth phase due to flocculation and sedimentation. We demonstrated two different mechanisms of phytoplankton aggregate formation. In the diatom S.costatum, the cells are sticky in themselves, and coagulation depends on cell-cell sticking and does not involve mucus. Aggregates are composed solely of cells. Cells of the diatom Chaetoceros affinis, on the other hand, are not in themselves sticky. Transparent exopolymeric particles (TEP), produced by the diatom, cause the cells to aggregate and coagulation depends on TEP-cell rather than cell-cell sticking. Aggregates are formed of a mixture of mucus and cells. We found several species of diatoms and one flagellate species to produce copious amounts of TEP. TEP from some species (e.g. Coscinodiscus sp.) is sticky and may cause other, non-sticky particles to coagulate. This emphasizes the potential importance of diatom-derived paniculate mucus for particle flocculation in the ocean. {\textcopyright} 1993 Oxford University Press.},

To test the accuracy of the model, the results were temporally and spatially compared to a passive scalar released simultaneously in the circulation model and to field data for zebra mussel veligers. The model was then used to study the effects of baroclinic density-driven flow, vertical sinking and swimming, and tidal vertical migration on retention of simulated zooplankton. Baroclinic flow, created by longitudinal and lateral salinity gradients, was a critical part of retention in the SLETZ. In the presence of baroclinic flow, vertical sinking and swimming speeds of ≥0.2 mm s-1 had a large effect on the residence time of the simulated zooplankton as a result of gravitational circulation. Tidal vertical migration - a pattern of upward movement on flood and downward movement on ebb - was a viable retention mechanism for the SLETZ, and its effectiveness was amplified by baroclinic flow. As the speed of tidal vertical migration increased, the simulated zooplankton were concentrated in smaller areas of the SLETZ and moved further upstream. {\textcopyright} 2006, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {We used hydrodynamic and particle-tracking models to investigate vertical movement of plankton and resulting retention in the San Francisco Estuary. The hydrodynamic model was UnTRIM, a three-dimensional, unstructured grid model, which had been calibrated to historical conditions in this estuary for 1994-1997, a period of widely varying hydrology. Intensive field studies of hydrodynamics and vertical movements of organisms during 1994-1996 provided input data for the models. The particle-tracking model was run with 14 alternative behaviors for three 45 d periods of contrasting hydrology. The behaviors included passive behavior, several simple tidal migration patterns, and several sinking speeds. Vertical positions of migrating and sinking particles resembled those seen in the field studies for copepods and epibenthos, respectively. Passive particles were advected from the estuary at rates that depended on freshwater flow. All of the non-passive behaviors caused retention of the particles in the low-salinity region of the estuary under some flow conditions. Tidal migration was very effective at maintaining position, but model results and a re-examination of the field data suggested that migration speed should increase with increasing freshwater flow. Continuous sinking was also effective at retention, particularly in deep areas of low tidal velocity. We conclude that the vertical distributions observed in the field studies were a result of active patterns of movement, that these patterns can result in retention, and that retention in a bathymetrically complex estuary can be understood only in the context of the full time-varying three-dimensional flow field. {\textcopyright} 2014, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {Tidal vertical migration by zooplankton is a common phenomenon in estuaries, usually associated with landward movement of meroplankton or position maintenance of holoplankton. Little is known about the persistence of this behavior, its spatial variability, or its response to changing environmental conditions. We extended a previous study of tidal movements of zooplankton in the low-salinity zone (LSZ) of the San Francisco estuary in 1994 to include data from two additional years with very different hydrology. Freshwater flow during sampling in 1995 was about 7-fold greater than in 1994; the LSZ was about 28 km further seaward, and gravitational circulation in the LSZ was strong. In 1996 freshwater flow and LSZ position were intermediate but, because the LSZ was in shallower water in 1996 than in 1995, gravitational circulation was uncommon. Behavior of copepods in both years was similar to that reported in 1994 with some tidal migration observed during most cruises. An exception was the introduced carnivorous copepod Tortanus dextrilobatus, which did not migrate and maintained a position deep in the water column (1995 only). In 1996, mysids mainly stayed near the bottom with evidence for vertical migration from only 1 of 6 data sets, whereas amphipods migrated slightly on a diel schedule; these behaviors contrasted with the tidal migration observed in 1994. The bay shrimp Crangon franciscorum did not appear to migrate, but was more abundant in the water column during both ebb and flood, suggesting passive vertical dispersal. Zooplankton did not appear to maintain position by interactions with lateral circulation cells. The results for copepods suggest rigidity in behavior with little or no relaxation of the vertical movement in 1995 when strong gravitational circulation would have made upstream movement relatively easy. Mysids and amphipods altered their behavior depending on local conditions related to freshwater flow.},
