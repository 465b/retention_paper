abstract = {We investigated the degree of flexibility in retention strategies of young fishes in the low-salinity zone (LSZ) of the San Francisco Estuary during years of highly variable river flow. We conducted depth-stratified sampling over three full tidal cycles in each year from 1994 to 1996. In 1994, exotic striped bass (Morone saxatilis), native longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys), and exotic yellowfin goby (Acanthogobus flavimanus) migrated tidally, occurring near the surface on flood tides and near the bottom on ebb tides. This strategy may have facilitated retention, because landward residual currents were absent in this drought year. During 1995, this behavior persisted for striped bass and yellowfin goby, even though landward residual currents were present under high river-flow conditions. In moderate river-flow conditions (1996), longfin smelt again migrated tidally, whereas at another station adjacent to shallow bays, longfin smelt, striped bass, and native delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) migrated on a reverse diel cycle, occurring near the surface by day and at depth by night. Reverse diel migration may facilitate horizontal transport and retention. Therefore, young fishes appeared to be behaviorally flexible in different environmental conditions to maximize retention. Vertical migrations may also enhance feeding success because zooplankton prey similarly migrated in the LSZ. Our study underscores the value of interdisciplinary studies in a variety of environmental conditions to decipher the range of organism behaviors promoting transport and retention in optimal habitats.},

abstract = {Calanoid copepods are among the most abundant metazoans in the ocean and constitute a vital trophic link within marine food webs. They possess relatively narrow swimming capabilities, yet are capable of significant self-locomotion under strong hydrodynamic conditions. Here we provide evidence for an active adaptation that allows these small organisms to adjust their motility in response to background flow. We track simultaneously and in three dimensions the motion of flow tracers and planktonic copepods swimming freely at several intensities of quasi-homogeneous, isotropic turbulence. We show that copepods synchronize the frequency of their relocation jumps with the frequency of small-scale turbulence by performing frequent relocation jumps of low amplitude that seem unrelated to localized hydrodynamic signals. We develop a model of plankton motion in turbulence that shows excellent quantitative agreement with our measurements when turbulence is significant. We find that, compared with passive tracers, active motion enhances the diffusion of organisms at low turbulence intensity whereas it dampens diffusion at higher turbulence levels. The existence of frequent jumps in a motion that is otherwise dominated by turbulent transport allows for the possibility of active locomotion and hence to transition from being passively advected to being capable of controlling diffusion. This behavioral response provides zooplankton with the capability to retain the benefits of self-locomotion despite turbulence advection and may help these organisms to actively control their distribution in dynamic environments. Our study reveals an active adaptation that carries strong fitness advantages and provides a realistic model of plankton motion in turbulence.},

abstract = {Spatial patchiness of plankton enhances fishery production and carbon export in the ocean. While diel vertical migration (DVM) has been identified as an important factor contributing to vertical patchiness, its effect on horizontal patchiness has never been investigated. We use a simple individual-based zooplankton model to examine the effect of DVM on the horizontal patchiness of four zooplankton groups with differing DVM patterns in a two-dimensional ocean circulation model. We find that zooplankton horizontal patchiness can be induced by two mechanisms: (1) in stratified waters, DVM can synchronize zooplankton vertical positions with the horizontal current velocities that drive them, resulting in horizontal patchiness; and (2) migrating zooplankton tend to aggregate in deep waters when they encounter sea bottom. Due to these mechanisms, zooplankton horizontal patchiness may be ubiquitous in the ocean, enhancing secondary production and fisheries.},

abstract = {Calanoid copepods represent a major component of the plankton community. These small animals reside in constantly flowing environments. Given the fundamental role of behaviour in their ecology, it is especially relevant to know how copepods perform in turbulent flows. By means of three-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry, we reconstructed the trajectories of hundreds of adult Eurytemora affinis swimming freely under realistic intensities of homogeneous turbulence. We demonstrate that swimming contributes substantially to the dynamics of copepods even when turbulence is significant. We show that the contribution of behaviour to the overall dynamics gradually reduces with turbulence intensity but regains significance at moderate intensity, allowing copepods to maintain a certain velocity relative to the flow. These results suggest that E. affinis has evolved an adaptive behavioural mechanism to retain swimming efficiency in turbulent flows. They suggest the ability of some copepods to respond to the hydrodynamic features of the surrounding flow. Such ability may improve survival and mating performance in complex and dynamic environments. However, moderate levels of turbulence cancelled gender-specific differences in the degree of space occupation and innate movement strategies. Our results suggest that the broadly accepted mate-searching strategies based on trajectory complexity and movement patterns are inefficient in energetic environments.},

abstract = {Tidal vertical migration by zooplankton is a common phenomenon in estuaries, usually associated with landward movement of meroplankton or position maintenance of holoplankton. Little is known about the persistence of this behavior, its spatial variability, or its response to changing environmental conditions. We extended a previous study of tidal movements of zooplankton in the low-salinity zone (LSZ) of the San Francisco estuary in 1994 to include data from two additional years with very different hydrology. Freshwater flow during sampling in 1995 was about 7-fold greater than in 1994; the LSZ was about 28 km further seaward, and gravitational circulation in the LSZ was strong. In 1996 freshwater flow and LSZ position were intermediate but, because the LSZ was in shallower water in 1996 than in 1995, gravitational circulation was uncommon. Behavior of copepods in both years was similar to that reported in 1994 with some tidal migration observed during most cruises. An exception was the introduced carnivorous copepod Tortanus dextrilobatus, which did not migrate and maintained a position deep in the water column (1995 only). In 1996, mysids mainly stayed near the bottom with evidence for vertical migration from only 1 of 6 data sets, whereas amphipods migrated slightly on a diel schedule; these behaviors contrasted with the tidal migration observed in 1994. The bay shrimp Crangon franciscorum did not appear to migrate, but was more abundant in the water column during both ebb and flood, suggesting passive vertical dispersal. Zooplankton did not appear to maintain position by interactions with lateral circulation cells. The results for copepods suggest rigidity in behavior with little or no relaxation of the vertical movement in 1995 when strong gravitational circulation would have made upstream movement relatively easy. Mysids and amphipods altered their behavior depending on local conditions related to freshwater flow.},

abstract = {Three widely used Lagrangian particle dispersion models (LPDMs)-the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT), Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT), and Flexible Particle (FLEXPART) models-are evaluated with measurements from the controlled tracerrelease experiments Cross-Appalachian Tracer Experiment (CAPTEX) and Across North America Tracer Experiment (ANATEX). The LPDMs are run forward in time driven by identical meteorological inputs from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) and several configurations of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, and the simulations of tracer concentrations are evaluated against the measurements with a ranking procedure derived from the combination of four statistical parameters. The statistical evaluation reveals that all three LPDMs have comparable skill in simulating the tracer plumes when driven by the same meteorological inputs, indicating that the differences in their formulations play a secondary role. Simulations with HYSPLIT and STILT demonstrate the benefit of using customized hourly WRF fields with 10-km horizontal grid spacing over the use of 3-hourly NARR fields with 32-km horizontal grid spacing. All three LPDMs perform better when the WRF wind fields in the planetary boundary layer are nudged to NARR, with FLEXPART benefitting the most. Case studies indicate that the nudging corrects an overestimate in plume transport speed possibly caused by a positive bias inWRFwind speeds near the surface. All three LPDMs also benefit from the use of time-averaged velocity and convective mass flux fields generated by WRF, but the impact on HYSPLIT and STILT is much greater than on FLEXPART. STILT backward runs perform as well as their forward counterparts, demonstrating this model's reversibility and its suitability for application to inverse flux estimates. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Estuaries are among the world's most productive ecosystems, but recent natural and anthropogenic changes have stressed these ecosystems. Tools to assess estuarine pelagic habitats are important to support and maintain healthy ecosystem function. In this work, we demonstrate that estuarine pelagic habitats can be identified by a simple ratio, termed the LE ratio, that takes into account the tidal excursion along a channel (a Lagrangian length scale) and the distance along that channel (an Eulerian length scale). To develop and assess this concept, numerical simulations of the 1D advection–dispersion equation of a conservative tracer and tidal excursion estimates based on data were used to formulize a conceptual model and to define exchange zones within a tidal channel. This conceptual model was then used to predict the extent of pelagic habitats in a terminal channel network in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta. Exchange zones mapped onto these channels were found to be in good agreement with independent estimates of residence time. Sensitivity analyses of the numerical model suggest that productive pelagic habitats can be expanded by a factor of 2 by either increasing dispersion or increasing spring–neap variability in mean tidal velocity. Such changes can also enhance flushing in upper channel reaches. These findings are relevant for tidal marsh restoration projects that aim to expand beneficial aquatic habitats by varying exchange or residence time over the spring–neap cycle, because this variability may interact synergistically with varying rates of phytoplankton growth due to spatiotemporal changes in environmental conditions.},

Different probability density functions are implemented to estimate the deterministic coefficient in the Langevin equation. Buoyancy effects are described through simplified plume rise formulations up to a complete set of equations for negatively and positively buoyant emissions, also including phase changes. MicroSpray is able to simulate different types of sources and emissions; it includes the treatment of obstacles and complex orography and offers several options to optimize the numerical runs.

abstract = {We used hydrodynamic and particle-tracking models to investigate vertical movement of plankton and resulting retention in the San Francisco Estuary. The hydrodynamic model was UnTRIM, a three-dimensional, unstructured grid model, which had been calibrated to historical conditions in this estuary for 1994-1997, a period of widely varying hydrology. Intensive field studies of hydrodynamics and vertical movements of organisms during 1994-1996 provided input data for the models. The particle-tracking model was run with 14 alternative behaviors for three 45 d periods of contrasting hydrology. The behaviors included passive behavior, several simple tidal migration patterns, and several sinking speeds. Vertical positions of migrating and sinking particles resembled those seen in the field studies for copepods and epibenthos, respectively. Passive particles were advected from the estuary at rates that depended on freshwater flow. All of the non-passive behaviors caused retention of the particles in the low-salinity region of the estuary under some flow conditions. Tidal migration was very effective at maintaining position, but model results and a re-examination of the field data suggested that migration speed should increase with increasing freshwater flow. Continuous sinking was also effective at retention, particularly in deep areas of low tidal velocity. We conclude that the vertical distributions observed in the field studies were a result of active patterns of movement, that these patterns can result in retention, and that retention in a bathymetrically complex estuary can be understood only in the context of the full time-varying three-dimensional flow field. {\textcopyright} 2014, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

To test the accuracy of the model, the results were temporally and spatially compared to a passive scalar released simultaneously in the circulation model and to field data for zebra mussel veligers. The model was then used to study the effects of baroclinic density-driven flow, vertical sinking and swimming, and tidal vertical migration on retention of simulated zooplankton. Baroclinic flow, created by longitudinal and lateral salinity gradients, was a critical part of retention in the SLETZ. In the presence of baroclinic flow, vertical sinking and swimming speeds of ≥0.2 mm s-1 had a large effect on the residence time of the simulated zooplankton as a result of gravitational circulation. Tidal vertical migration - a pattern of upward movement on flood and downward movement on ebb - was a viable retention mechanism for the SLETZ, and its effectiveness was amplified by baroclinic flow. As the speed of tidal vertical migration increased, the simulated zooplankton were concentrated in smaller areas of the SLETZ and moved further upstream. {\textcopyright} 2006, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {Physical and chemical vertical gradients in estuaries are often steep, with changes on the scale of cm to m strongly affecting a phytoplankter's exposure to limiting nutrients and light. Two diel field studies were conducted during June and July 2001 to establish how the composition and productivity of the phytoplankton are influenced by the vertical water column structure within the shallow, eutrophic, microtidal Neuse River Estuary, North Carolina, USA. During both studies, an upper photic mixed layer with low dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) (∼1 $\mu$M) lay above a sub-halocline, aphotic region with elevated DIN (̃2 to 5 $\mu$M). Phytoflagellates were dominant, and observed diel vertical migration (DVM) patterns are likely an important reason for their success in this N-limited system characterized by strong vertical separation of light and DIN resources. Integrated water column primary productivities during June and July were 15 and 113% greater, respectively, than expected for a vertically homogenous phytoplankton community. The high degree of productivity enhancement in July was due to daytime near-surface aggregation in response to low-light, overcast conditions. Displacements of flagellate populations during DVM were positively correlated with cell size, exposing larger cells to higher light and nutrient levels over the diel period. Since larger phytoplankton are generally less efficient at utilizing scarce resources, such vertical niche partitioning according to cell size should enhance community-level productivity. Interspecific variation in vertical migration patterns is an important trait of phytoplankton that promotes complementarity of resource utilization and contributes to the relationship between diversity and productivity within phytoplankton communities. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2011.},

abstract = {Lagrangian particle tracking, based on currents derived from hydrodynamic models, is an important tool in quantifying bio-physical transports in the ocean. Particle tracking in the unstructured grids typically used in coastal regions is computationally slow, limiting the number of particles and ranges of behaviours that can be modeled. Techniques used in a new offline particle tracker “OceanTracker” are shown to be two orders of magnitude faster than those used in an existing ocean particle tracker for unstructured grids when run on a single computer core. More significantly, its computational speed can exceed that achieved when particle tracking on a regular grid. The techniques for unstructured grids make it possible to routinely calculate the trajectories of millions of particles. This large number of particles allows much better estimates of dispersion and transport statistics, particularly when the probability of connection is low but the consequences are significant, e.g. the spread of invasive species. It also enables wider exploration of parameter sensitivity and particles' bio-physical behaviours to provide more robust results. The speed increases result largely from exploiting history and reuse within the spatial interpolation of the hydrodynamic model's output. Using multiple computer cores further increased the speed to track a given number of particles.},
